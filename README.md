Use W to accelerate and S to slow down. Use A and D to turn your spaceship. Spaceships maintains the current speed while not accelerating or slowing down. 
When it's accelerating, engine fire is visible.
Use spacebar to shoot.
Shooting an asteroid will give you points, and break the asteroids into smaller chunks. Bigger asteroids give more points. Asteroids spawn at random time intervals, at a minimum distance from the player.
Getting hit will remove the asteroid, without breaking it into smaller ones, and without giving player points. 
Player has 3 lives in total, which are shown on the wings.
